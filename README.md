# **ST Web Bluetooth App Interfaces**

***

## **What is Web Bluetooth ?**
The Web Bluetooth API is a new specification that allows us to communicate directly to Bluetooth Low Energy devices from the browser. 


## **Browser compatibility with the API Web BluetoothÂ®.**

On a **desktop** computer: Chrome, Edge and Opera browsers are compatible.  
On a **smartphone** device: Chrome android is the only browser compatible.  
See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API documentation.
You may need to enable experimental web platform features in your browser preference.

***

# **Usage**

Two github pages hosting the web app are available:
-   [Web Bluetooth **WBA**](https://AppliBLE.github.io/Web_Bluetooth_App_WBA "https://AppliBLE.github.io/Web_Bluetooth_App_WBA").
-   [Web Bluetooth **WB**](https://AppliBLE.github.io/Web_Bluetooth_App_WB "https://AppliBLE.github.io/Web_Bluetooth_App_WB").
  
No installation is required to use it this way.

You can host locally the server to update the source code, see [*Development mode*](#development-mode).

If you are unsure which of the two pages to choose, see [*WBA or WB*](#wba-or-wb).
